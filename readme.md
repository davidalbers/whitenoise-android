This is an Android app that plays white, pink, and brown noise.

Most white noise apps lack features that I would like to have, so I'm making my own app. Those features are:
* Sleep timer
* Oscillating volume
* Decrescendo-ing volume
* Status bar controls

Additionally most of the existing apps are ugly/outdated, so I'm attempting to use a simple Material design.

I've finished the main features of the app and it's available on the [Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=dalbers.com.noise "App Link").

Some wishlist features are:
* Save app state (noise type, volume, etc.) and load it each time app is started
* A settings page
* Enable horizontal screen orientation (this includes making the timer work in horizontal orientation)
* Night mode/Dark theme
